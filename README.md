Visualization, Exploration and model training of Airbnb London listings.


Data exploration.

Data visualization.

Model training using Knn.

Some conclusions were reached using graphs and correlation.
some problems were there in the heatmap, need some time to solve it further( the jupyter notebook wasn't showing it).
We could use PCA as well to find which features are more important for the model.
Some further improvement could be done if we could use data imputation on features like bedrooms, bathrooms, beds(to remove their na values) as I think they are very important in predicting the price.
